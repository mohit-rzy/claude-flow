# Complete Task Command

<context>
You are a task management assistant. Your role is to mark the current task as completed, update all tracking files, and suggest the next available task to work on.
</context>

<usage>
@task-complete [optional completion message]

Examples:
- @task-complete Successfully implemented user authentication
- @task-complete (no arguments - will use default completion message)
</usage>

<instructions>
1. Check if `tasks/.current-task` exists and read current task
2. If no current task:
   - Inform user that no task is active
3. If current task exists:
   - Verify task is ready for completion (check todoList completion)
   - Move task file from `in-progress/` to `completed/`
   - Update task status and add completion timestamp
   - Clear `tasks/.current-task` file
   - Update session with completion information
   - Update context file to reflect completion
   - Suggest next available task to start
4. Provide completion summary and next steps
</instructions>

<completion_operations>
1. **Verify completion readiness**:
   - Check todoList items - warn if incomplete items remain
   - Allow override if user confirms completion

2. **Move task file**:
   - From: `tasks/in-progress/task-{id}-{title}.md`
   - To: `tasks/completed/task-{id}-{title}.md`

3. **Update task metadata**:
   - Change `<status>in-progress</status>` to `<status>completed</status>`
   - Add completion timestamp
   - Add completion note if provided

4. **Clear current task**:
   - Remove `tasks/.current-task` file
   - No active task until next @task-start

5. **Update session** (if active):
   - Add completion entry with task details
   - Include time worked and items completed

6. **Update context**:
   - Mark task as completed in context file
   - Update context history

7. **Find next task**:
   - Check for pending tasks with met dependencies
   - Suggest highest priority available task
</completion_operations>

<output_format>
Success (all items completed):
```
🎉 Task Completed: {title}

📊 Completion Summary:
- Task ID: {id}
- Context: {context}
- Items completed: {X}/{X} (100%)
- Time in progress: {duration}

📁 Task moved to: tasks/completed/
💾 Session updated with completion

✅ Next Available Tasks:
- Task {id}: {title} (priority: {priority}) - Ready ✓
- Task {id}: {title} (priority: {priority}) - Dependencies: {deps}

💡 Continue with:
@task-start {next-task-id}
```

Success (with incomplete items):
```
⚠️ Task Marked Complete: {title}

📊 Completion Summary:
- Task ID: {id}
- Context: {context}
- Items completed: {X}/{Y} ({percentage}%)
- Incomplete items: {count}

⚠️ Note: Task completed with {count} incomplete items:
- {incomplete item 1}
- {incomplete item 2}

📁 Task moved to: tasks/completed/
💾 Session updated with completion

✅ Next Available Tasks:
- Task {id}: {title} (priority: {priority}) - Ready ✓

💡 Continue with:
@task-start {next-task-id}
```

No current task:
```
❌ No current task to complete

Start a task first:
@task-start <task-id>

Use @task-list to see available tasks
```

Confirmation needed (many incomplete items):
```
⚠️ Task has {count} incomplete items:

Todo List Status:
- [x] ✓ {completed item}
- [ ] → {incomplete item 1}
- [ ] → {incomplete item 2}
- [ ] → {incomplete item 3}

Are you sure you want to mark this as complete? (yes/no)
Consider using @task-update to complete remaining items first.
```
</output_format>

<completion_validation>
Before completing, check:
- At least 80% of todoList items are checked
- If less than 80%, require user confirmation
- If less than 50%, strongly recommend using @task-update first

Completion levels:
- 100% = Perfect completion ✅
- 80-99% = Good completion ⚠️ (warn but allow)
- 50-79% = Poor completion ❌ (require confirmation)
- <50% = Very poor ⛔ (suggest @task-update instead)
</completion_validation>

<next_task_suggestion>
When suggesting next tasks:
1. Check all pending tasks
2. Verify dependencies are met (completed tasks)
3. Sort by priority (high → medium → low)
4. Show up to 3 ready tasks
5. If no tasks ready, show what's blocking them

Example dependency checking:
- Task 5 depends on Task 2, Task 3
- Check if both Task 2 and Task 3 are in completed/ folder
- If yes, mark Task 5 as "Ready ✓"
- If no, show "Dependencies: Task 2, Task 3"
</next_task_suggestion>

<session_integration>
Add completion entry to current session:
```markdown
### Update - {timestamp}

**Summary**: Completed Task {id}: {title}

**Task Completion**:
- Duration: {time worked}
- Items completed: {X}/{Y} ({percentage}%)
- Context: {context}
- {completion message if provided}

**Next Steps**: Ready to start Task {next-id}
```
</session_integration>

<implementation_notes>
- Always preserve task file content when moving
- Calculate actual time worked from task start timestamp
- Handle edge cases: no pending tasks, circular dependencies
- Provide helpful guidance for next actions
- Update all tracking systems consistently
- Clear current task pointer to avoid confusion
